# Slide Puzzle Web Application

Welcome to the Slide Puzzle Web Application! This project is a classic sliding puzzle game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to rearrange a grid of numbered tiles to achieve a specific order by sliding tiles into an adjacent empty space.


## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click on tiles to slide them into the empty space, following the classic sliding puzzle mechanics.
- **Randomized Start**: The puzzle initializes with a random configuration, ensuring a unique challenge every time you play.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Arrange the tiles in ascending numerical order, with the empty space in the bottom-right corner.
2. **Move Tiles**: Click on a tile adjacent to the empty space to slide it into the empty space.
3. **Win Condition**: The game is won when all tiles are in the correct order.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic, including tile shuffling, movement, and win condition checks.


## Future Development Plans
We have exciting plans to further develop and enhance the Slide Puzzle Web Application. Here are some of the features and improvements we aim to implement:

- Customizable Grid Sizes: Allow players to choose different grid sizes (e.g., 4x4, 5x5) for varying levels of difficulty.
- Image Puzzles: Enable users to upload their own images to be used as the puzzle instead of numbered tiles.
- Timer and Move Counter: Add a timer and move counter to track and display the time taken and the number of moves made by the player.
- Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard to display high scores and fastest times, encouraging competition among players.
- Undo and Reset Options: Provide options to undo the last move or reset the puzzle to its initial state.
- Sound Effects and Animations: Enhance the user experience with sound effects and animations for tile movements.
- Mobile Optimization: Further optimize the application for mobile devices to ensure a smooth and responsive experience on all screen sizes.
- Accessibility Improvements: Make the application more accessible by adding keyboard controls and improving compatibility with screen readers.
